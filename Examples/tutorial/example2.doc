API Documentation
=================

- For some reason I don't like the __Javadoc__ concept of in-source comments for
  creating the documentation.
- Instead of bloating my source code I want to keep the documentation in a
  separate file.
- Consider some C++ source file __func.cc__ that provides some functions or
  classes declared in __func.h__.  Then *doctool* will create some doc-file
  stub __func.doc.txt__.
- You see that the `CODEREF` box in the doc-file is logically linked with the
  declaration in the header file through the USR identifier below the box.
- If you modify the function declaration in __func.h__ the following happens:
   - If you just modify the formation the CODEREF box gets updated.
   - If you add a function to the header file __func.h__ and a definition to the
     source file __func.cc__ a new stub gets added to __func.doc.txt__.
   - If you only add a declaration to __func.h__ *nothing happens*.  Because
     forward declarations are ignored.
   - If you change the signature of a function or if you remove a function the
     `CODEREF` block becomes obsolete.  *doctool* will stop and tell you where
     obsolete blocks are located.  Unless you remove these blocks *doctool*
     will not go further (zero tolerance).
- Some API documentation with a bit more text: __dummy.h__, __dummy.cc__ and
  __dummy.doc__.
