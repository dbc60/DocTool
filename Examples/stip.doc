A _*Hello world* program_ is a computer program that prints out "Hello world"
on a display device. It is typically one of the simplest programs possible in
most programming languages. Therefore, by tradition, it is often the first
program taught in a beginning class on a particular language. It is also used to
illustrate the most basic syntax of a programming language.


Purpose
=======
A "hello world" program has become the traditional first program that many
people learn. In general, it is simple enough that people who have no previous
experience with computer programming can easily understand it, especially with
the guidance of a teacher or a written guide. Using this simple program as a
basis, computer science principles or elements of a specific programming
language can be explained to novice programmers. Experienced programmers
learning new languages can also gain a lot of information about a given
language's syntax and structure from a hello world program.

Sanity Test
-----------
In addition, hello world can be a useful sanity test to make sure that a
language's compiler, development environment, and run-time environment are
correctly installed. Configuring a complete programming tool chain from scratch
to the point where even trivial programs can be compiled and run can involve
substantial amounts of work. For this reason, a simple program is used first
when testing a new tool chain.

Hackers
-------
"Hello world" is also used by computer hackers as a proof of concept that
arbitrary code can be executed through an exploit where the system designers did
not intend code to be executedâ€”for example, on Sony's PlayStation Portable.
This is the first step in using homemade content ("homebrew") on such a device.
